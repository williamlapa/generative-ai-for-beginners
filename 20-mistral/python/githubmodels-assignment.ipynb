      "The author primarily worked on two things before college: writing and programming. In terms of writing, they wrote short stories, although they admit that these stories were not very good, lacking plot and consisting mostly of characters with strong feelings. As for programming, the author started writing programs on an IBM 1401 when they were in 9th grade (13 or 14 years old). The programs were written in an early version of Fortran, and the code had to be typed onto punch cards and loaded into the computer using a card reader. However, the author faced difficulties in figuring out what to do with the IBM 1401, as the only form of input was data stored on punched cards, which they didn't have, and the only other option was to do things that didn't rely on any input, like calculating approximations of pi, but they didn't know enough math to do anything interesting of that type.\n"
